## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to find trends in usage and trip duration for bike rides. 


## Results
As stated in the Tableau story, there were a few interesting discoveries made in the data:
  1. Most trips were around 5 minutes, and then normalized around 20 minutes. There were very few trips that lasted more than 50 minutes. 
  2. The most active hours were on the weekdays (M-F) in the mornings and evenings. Weekends were also quite active in the late-mornings to evenings.
  3. Findings 1 & 2 coincided with data breaking down users by gender, where there were more males than females. 
  4. Subscribers are more active than non-subscribers, however there is no data for those who chose not to specify their gender. For non-subscribers those with
  an "unknown" gender identity were most active.
  
## Summary
In sum, trips that lasted from 5-20 minutes were the most common, the most active hours are usually when people commute to and from work, subscribers are more active than non-subscribers, and there are no subscribers with an "unknown" gender identity. The two additional visualizations I would recommend would be to find the most active stations by time to show how to distribute the bikes, and a chart on the amount of subscribers by gender to further inform our analyses and see if they follow current trends.
